# Sublime minify on save
It is a sublime plugin to minify .js and .css file when you save them.

## Quick start
To use it, you just need to follow the steps below

* Install [Minifier](https://github.com/bistory/Sublime-Minifier "Minifier") plugin on your Sublime
* Create a new plugin (`Tools > New Plugin...`) and copy/paste the `minify_on_save.py` code

### Minifier Recommended Configurations
If you want a better experience, add this line below to your Minifier Settings file (`Preferences > Package Settings > Minifier > Minifier Settings - User`)
```json
{
    "open_on_min": false
}
```
This line just makes it not open the minified file when it is created.
